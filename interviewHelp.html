<p><b>Choosing Questions</b></p>
<p>Remember what your Team Leader pointed out to you.</p>
<p>There may be two or more ways to ask the same basic question.  Use your best judgment to decide which one might elicit the best answer.  With Trojan Grocers, one question you pose to Danny Ortega actually causes him to react with a serious response.</p>

<p><b>Accessing Questions</b></p>
<p>You will see a group of questions for each executive.  Check the up and down arrows at the bottom right of the Questions box.  There may be additional questions revealed as you select the down arrow.  There is no specific order in which to ask the questions.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are two ways to ask the same question, so choose wisely, they could affect the response.</p>

<p><b>Clock</b></p>
<p>The executives are busy and have a limited time to be questioned. There's a clock that let's you know how much time is left for each of your interviews. It won't start moving until you ask the first question. In most cases, it is a good strategy to look over all of your question choices before you start. Take notes and be prepared to ask the most appropriate ones.</p> 
<p>You will need to have a question completely answered before you ask another.</p>

<p><b>Charts</b></p>
<p>In the Janet Ferguson interview, you should definitely have copies of the different charts in front of you. She goes through them briskly, so you may have to repeat the Interview to grasp her directions.</p>
