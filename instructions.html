	<p>You are the ones “asking” the questions, and are what is commonly referred to in the CPG industry as “Business Development Managers” for Washaway Clean (WAC). Your relationship to Trojan Grocer (TG) is a selling relationship, but also a “consultative” one (i.e., you offer advice to increase profitability and sales in this highly margin-conscious industry).</p>
	<p>This is an exercise modeled after a real-world training scenario used in the past by Procter & Gamble to train U.S. employees on the concept of “Category Management”.</p>
	<p>Category Management is the process of managing the 4P’s of a product category in a manner that maximizes sales and profitability. The intent of all Category Management projects is to create mutually beneficial gains for both the manufacturer (e.g., Procter & Gamble) and the distributor (e.g., a retailer like Target).</p>
	<p>As you assume the role of Business Managers for Washaway Clean, you should be aware of the fact that they are operating in a B2B setting (the relationship is between WAC and TG).</p>
