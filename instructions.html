<div class="instructions">
	<p>This is an exercise modeled after a real-world training scenario used in the past by Procter & Gamble to train U.S. employees on the concept of “Category Management”.</p>
	<p>You are the ones “asking” the questions, and are what is commonly referred to in the CPG industry as “Business Development Managers” for Washaway Clean (WAC). Your relationship to Trojan Grocer (TG) is a selling relationship, but also a “consultative” one (i.e., you offer advice to increase profitability and sales in this highly margin-conscious industry).</p>
	<p>Category Management is the process of managing the 4P’s of a product category in a manner that maximizes sales and profitability. The intent of all Category Management projects is to create mutually beneficial gains for both the manufacturer (e.g., Procter & Gamble) and the distributor (e.g., a retailer like Target).</p>
	<p>As you assume the role of Business Managers for Washaway Clean, you should be aware of the fact that they are operating in a B2B setting (the relationship is between WAC and TG).</p>

		<p><b>Team Leaders</b>, who are responsible for sales results in a specific region or channel, have a wide variety of backgrounds and personalities. They do, however, share some common characteristics such as: strong analytical abilities, excellent negotiating skills, a talent for strategic planning, and a strong drive to achieve results.</p>
		<p>In this case, your Team Leader is a young, “up-and-coming” executive who will soon rise through the ranks to manage WAC sales for a bigger, national retailer (a chain such as Target).</p>
		<p>Over time, his drive and his ability to achieve results will help him rise to positions with even more responsibility (Associate Director of West Coast Sales, for example). Despite his young age, he has a great deal of knowledge about this industry, which he acquired through experience as well as through his education as a business major in college.</p>
